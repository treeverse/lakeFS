# Using lakeFS with Spark
{: .no_toc }
[Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/) is a unified analytics engine for big data processing, with built-in modules for streaming, SQL, machine learning and graph processing.

Accessing data in lakeFS from Spark is the same as accessing S3 data from Spark.
The only changes we need to consider are:
1. Setting the configurations to access lakeFS
2. Accessing Objects with the lakeFS path convention



## Configuration
In order to configure Spark to work with lakeFS we will set the lakeFS credentials in the corresponding S3 credential fields.
    
lakeFS endpoint: ```fs.s3a.endpoint``` 

lakeFS access key: ```fs.s3a.access.key```

lakeFS secret key: ```fs.s3a.secret.key```

**Note** 
In the following examples we set AWS credentials at runtime, for clarity. In production, these properties should be set using one of Hadoop's standard ways of [Authenticating with S3](https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/hadoop-aws/tools/hadoop-aws/index.html#Authenticating_with_S3){:target="_blank"}. 
{: .note}

For example if we would like to Specify the credentials at run time 
```scala
spark.sparkContext.hadoopConfiguration.set("fs.s3a.access.key", "AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE")
spark.sparkContext.hadoopConfiguration.set("fs.s3a.secret.key", "wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY")
spark.sparkContext.hadoopConfiguration.set("fs.s3a.endpoint", "https://example.lakefs.io")
```

   
   
## Accessing Objects
In order for us to access objects in lakeFS we will need to use the lakeFS path conventions:
    ```s3a://[REPOSITORY]/[BRANCH]/PATH/TO/OBJECT```

For example: 
Lets assume we want to read the parquet file: 
   ``` title.basics.parquet ```

from repository: ```example```
branch: ```master```
in the path: ```collection/shows```
      
```scala
val repo = "example"
val branch = "master"
val workDir = s"s3a://${repo}/${branch}/collection/shows"
val dataPath = s"$workDir/title.basics.parquet"
...
...

val basics = spark.read.option("header", "true").parquet(dataPath)
```

## Creating Objects

If we would like to create new parquet files partitioned by titleType
```scala
basics.toDF().write.partitionBy("titleType").parquet(outputPathByType)
```
