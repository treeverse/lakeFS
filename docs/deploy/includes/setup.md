## Create the admin user

When you first open the lakeFS UI, you will be asked to create an initial admin user.

1. open `http://<lakefs-host>/` in your browser. If you haven't set up a load balancer, this will likely be `http://<instance ip address>:8000/`
1. On first use, you'll be redirected to the setup page:
