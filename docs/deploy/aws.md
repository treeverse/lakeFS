# Deploy lakeFS on AWS

Expected deployment time: 25 min

## Preparing the Database for the Key Value Store

lakeFS uses a key-value store to synchronize actions on your repositories. Out of the box, this key-value store can rely on DynamoDB or a PostgreSQL DB. As lakeFS open source, you can also write your own implementation and use any other DB
The following two sections explain how to setup either PostgreSQL or DynamoDB as key-value backing DB

### Creating PostgreSQL Database on AWS RDS

We will show you how to create a database on AWS RDS but you can use any PostgreSQL database as long as it's accessible by your lakeFS installation.

If you already have a database, take note of the connection string and skip to the [next step](#installation-options)

1. Follow the official [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/CHAP_GettingStarted.CreatingConnecting.PostgreSQL.html){: target="_blank" } on how to create a PostgreSQL instance and connect to it.
   You may use the default PostgreSQL engine, or [Aurora PostgreSQL](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/Aurora.AuroraPostgreSQL.html){: target="_blank" }. Make sure that you're using PostgreSQL version >= 11.
2. Once your RDS is set up and the server is in `Available` state, take note of the endpoint and port.

3. Make sure your security group rules allow you to connect to the database instance.

### DynamoDB on AWS

DynamoDB on AWS does not require any specific preparation, other than properly configuring lakeFS to use it and valid AWS credentials. Please refer to `database.dynamodb` section in the [configuration reference](../reference/configuration.md#reference) for complete configuration options.
AWS credentials, for DynamoDB, can also be provided via environment variables, as described in the [configuration reference](../reference/configuration.md#using-environment-variables)
Please refer to [AWS documentation](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/getting-started/) for further information on DynamoDB

## Installation Options

### On EC2

1. Edit and save the following configuration file as `config.yaml`:

   ```yaml
   ---
   database:
     type: "postgres" OR "dynamodb"

     # when using dynamodb
     dynamodb: 
       table_name: "[DYNAMODB_TABLE_NAME]"
       aws_region: "[DYNAMODB_REGION]"

     # when using postgres
     postgres:
       connection_string: "[DATABASE_CONNECTION_STRING]"

   auth:
     encrypt:
       # replace this with a randomly-generated string:
       secret_key: "[ENCRYPTION_SECRET_KEY]"

   blockstore:
     type: s3
     s3:
       region: us-east-1 # optional, fallback in case discover from bucket is not supported
   ```

1. [Download the binary](../index.md#downloads) to the EC2 instance.
1. Run the `lakefs` binary on the EC2 instance:
   ```sh
   lakefs --config config.yaml run
   ```
   **Note:** It's preferable to run the binary as a service using systemd or your operating system's facilities.

### On ECS

To support container-based environments like AWS ECS, lakeFS can be configured using environment variables. Here are a couple of `docker run` 
commands to demonstrate starting lakeFS using Docker:

#### With PostgreSQL

```sh
docker run \
  --name lakefs \
  -p 8000:8000 \
  -e LAKEFS_DATABASE_TYPE="postgres" \
  -e LAKEFS_DATABASE_POSTGRES_CONNECTION_STRING="[DATABASE_CONNECTION_STRING]" \
  -e LAKEFS_AUTH_ENCRYPT_SECRET_KEY="[ENCRYPTION_SECRET_KEY]" \
  -e LAKEFS_BLOCKSTORE_TYPE="s3" \
  treeverse/lakefs:latest run
```

#### With DynamoDB

```sh
docker run \
  --name lakefs \
  -p 8000:8000 \
  -e LAKEFS_DATABASE_TYPE: "dynamodb" \
  -e LAKEFS_DATABASE_DYNAMODB_TABLE_NAME="[DYNAMODB_TABLE_NAME]" \
  -e LAKEFS_AUTH_ENCRYPT_SECRET_KEY="[ENCRYPTION_SECRET_KEY]" \
  -e LAKEFS_BLOCKSTORE_TYPE="s3" \
  treeverse/lakefs:latest run
```

See the [reference](../reference/configuration.md#using-environment-variables) for a complete list of environment variables.

### On EKS

See [Kubernetes Deployment](./k8s.md).

## Load balancing

Depending on how you chose to install lakeFS, you should have a load balancer direct requests to the lakeFS server.  
By default, lakeFS operates on port 8000, and exposes a `/_health` endpoint which you can use for health checks.

### Notes for using an AWS Application Load Balancer
{: .no_toc }

1. Your security groups should allow the load balancer to access the lakeFS server.
1. Create a target group with a listener for port 8000.
1. Setup TLS termination using the domain names you wish to use (e.g., `lakefs.example.com` and potentially `s3.lakefs.example.com`, `*.s3.lakefs.example.com` if using [virtual-host addressing](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/VirtualHosting.html)).
1. Configure the health-check to use the exposed `/_health` URL

## Next Steps

Your next step is to [prepare your storage](../setup/storage/index.md). If you already have a storage bucket/container, you're ready to [create your first lakeFS repository](../setup/create-repo.md).
