> Managed Garbage Collection is only available for [lakeFS Cloud](../cloud/). If you are using self-managed lakeFS, [Garbage collection](../howto/garbage-collection-index.md) is available to run manually.

## The benefits of using managed GC on lakeFS cloud are:
* Advanced Engine to detect and delete objects quickly and safely
* Managed Solution
* Garbage Collection SLA
* Support

## How does it work?
lakeFS Cloud Managed Garbage Collection is using the same configuration of [garbage collection rules](../howto/garbage-collection-index.md) that are used in the self-managed version of lakeFS, but, we run it on our infrastructure, with a super-fast and efficient engine to detect stale objects and branches (depends on your configuration) and prioritize them for deletion.

## Setting up Managed Garbage Collection
lakeFS Cloud Onboarding Setup Wizard contains a toggle to enable Managed GC. This will create additional cloud resources for us to use and have access to delete those objects.
