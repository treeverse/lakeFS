# Rolling back Changes in lakeFS

Our intrepid user (you) merged a change back into the `main` branch and realised that they had made a mistake 🤦🏻. 

The good news for them (you) is that lakeFS can revert changes made, similar to how you would in Git 😅. 

From your terminal window run `lakectl` with the `revert` command:

```bash
docker exec -it lakefs lakectl branch revert lakefs://quickstart/main main --parent-number 1 --yes
```
You should see a confirmation of a successful rollback:
```
Branch: lakefs://quickstart/main
commit main successfully reverted
```

Back in the object page and the DuckDB query we can see that the original file is now back to how it was:
