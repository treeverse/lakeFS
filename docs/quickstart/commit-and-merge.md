_In the previous step we branched our data from `main` into a new `denmark-lakes` branch, and overwrote the `lakes.parquet` to hold solely information about lakes in Denmark. Now we're going to commit that change (just like Git) and merge it back to main (just like git)._

# Committing Changes in lakeFS

Having make the change to the datafile in the `denmark-lakes` branch, we now want to commit it. There are various options for interacting with the lakeFS API, including the web interface, [a Python client](https://pydocs.lakefs.io/), and `lakectl` which is what we'll use here. Run the following from a terminal window:

```bash
docker exec lakefs lakectl commit lakefs://quickstart/denmark-lakes -m "Create a dataset of just the lakes in Denmark"
```

You will get confirmation of the commit including its hash.
```
Branch: lakefs://quickstart/denmark-lakes

```

With our change committed, it's now time to merge it to back to the `main` branch. 

# Merging Branches in lakeFS üîÄ

As above, we'll use `lakectl` to do this too. The syntax just requires us to specify the source and target of the merge. Run this from a terminal window.

```bash
docker exec lakefs lakectl merge lakefs://quickstart/denmark-lakes lakefs://quickstart/main
```

We can confirm that this has worked by returning to the same object view of `lakes.parquet` as before and clicking on **Execute** to rerun the same query. You'll see that the country row counts have changed, and only Denmark is left in the data:

**But‚Ä¶oh no!** A slow chill creeps down your spine, and the bottom drops out of your stomach. What have you done! üò± *You were supposed to create **a separate file** of Denmark's lakes - not replace the original one*

Is all lost? Will our hero overcome the obstacles? No, and yes respectively!

Have no fear; lakeFS can revert changes. Tune in for the final part of the quickstart to see how.
