# 👩🏻‍💻 Spin up the environment 👨🏻‍💻

{: .note}
If you don't want to use Docker, you can use the [30-day free trial of lakeFS Cloud](https://lakefs.cloud/register). Once you launch the free trial you will have access to the same content as this quickstart within the provided repository once you login.

_The quickstart uses Docker to bring up the lakeFS container, pre-populate it with some data, and also provides DuckDB from where we can interact with the data. You'll need [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed to run this._

Launch the lakeFS container:

```bash
docker run --name lakefs --pull always \
             --rm --publish 8000:8000 \
             treeverse/lakefs:latest \
             run --quickstart
```

After a few moments you should see the lakeFS container ready to use: 

```
│
│ lakeFS running in quickstart mode.
│     Login at http://127.0.0.1:8000/
│
│     Access Key ID    : AKIAIOSFOLQUICKSTART
│     Secret Access Key: wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY

```

You will see the sample repository created and the quickstart guide within it. You can follow along there, or here - it's the same :)
