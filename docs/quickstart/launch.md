# 👩🏻‍💻 Spin up the environment 👨🏻‍💻

_The quickstart uses Docker Compose to bring up the lakeFS container, pre-populate it with some data, and also provide a DuckDB container from where we can interact with the data. You'll need [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) installed to run this._

The first step is to clone the lakeFS Git repository:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:treeverse/lakeFS.git
cd lakeFS/quickstart
```

and then launch the environment with Docker Compose:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

After a few moments you should see the lakeFS container ready to use:

You're now ready to dive into lakeFS! 

Login to lakeFS's web interface at [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000) using these credentials:

* **Access Key ID**: `AKIA-EXAMPLE-KEY`
* **Secret Access Key**: `EXAMPLE-SECRET`

You'll see that there's a repository that's been created automagically for you, imaginatively called `quickstart`. Click on the repository name to open it.

Now we're ready to explore the data that's been loaded into the quickstart environment.
