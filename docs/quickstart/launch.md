# 👩🏻‍💻 Spin up the environment 👨🏻‍💻

_The quickstart uses Docker to bring up the lakeFS container, pre-populate it with some data, and also provides DuckDB from where we can interact with the data. You'll need [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed to run this._

Launch the lakeFS container:

```bash
docker run --name lakefs \
           --rm --publish 8000:8000 \
           treeverse/lakefs:latest-duckdb \
             run --local-settings
```

After a few moments you should see the lakeFS container ready to use:

You will see the sample repository created and the quickstart guide within it. You can follow along there, or here - it's the same :)
