_The quickstart uses Docker to bring up the lakeFS container, pre-populate it with some data, and also provides DuckDB from where we can interact with the data. You'll need [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed to run this._

Launch the lakeFS container:

```bash
docker run --name lakefs \
           --rm --publish 8000:8000 \
           --entrypoint "/bin/sh" \
           --env "LAKECTL_CREDENTIALS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=AKIA-EXAMPLE-KEY" \
           --env "LAKECTL_CREDENTIALS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=EXAMPLE-SECRET" \
           --env "LAKECTL_SERVER_ENDPOINT_URL=http://localhost:8000" \
           treeverse/lakefs:latest -c \
           "lakefs setup --local-settings --user-name admin --access-key-id \"AKIA-EXAMPLE-KEY\" --secret-access-key \"EXAMPLE-SECRET\"; \ 
            lakefs run --local-settings"
```

After a few moments you should see the lakeFS container ready to use:

You're now ready to dive into lakeFS! 

1. Login to lakeFS's web interface at [http://127.0.0.1:8000/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/).

2. You notice that there aren't any repositories created yet. Click the **Create Sample Repository** button.

3. Specify `quickstart` as the repository name, leave the other settings unchanged, and click **Create Repository**

    <img width="50%" src="/assets/img/quickstart/create-quickstart-repo.png" alt="Creating the quickstart sample repo in lakeFS" class="quickstart"/>

You will see the sample repository created and the quickstart guide within it. You can follow along there, or here - it's the same :)
