# 👩🏻‍💻 Spin up the environment 👨🏻‍💻

_The quickstart uses Docker to bring up the lakeFS container, pre-populate it with some data, and also provides DuckDB from where we can interact with the data. You'll need [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed to run this._

Launch the lakeFS container:

```bash
docker run --name lakefs \
           --rm --publish 8000:8000 \
           treeverse/lakefs:latest \
           run --local-settings
```

After a few moments you should see the lakeFS container ready to use:

You're now ready to dive into lakeFS! 

1. Login to lakeFS's web interface at [http://127.0.0.1:8000/setup](http://127.0.0.1:8000/setup). Enter your email address and click on **Setup**.

2. On the next screen you'll see the generated authentication key pair - make a note of these (or download them using the button provided).
