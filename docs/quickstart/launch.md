# Spin up the environment

{: .note}
If you don't want to use Docker, you can use the [30-day free trial of lakeFS Cloud](https://lakefs.cloud/register). Once you launch the free trial you will have access to the same content as this quickstart within the provided repository once you login.

_The quickstart uses Docker to bring up the lakeFS container, pre-populate it with some data, and also provides DuckDB from where we can interact with the data. You'll need [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed to run this._

Launch the lakeFS container:

```bash
docker run --name lakefs --pull always --rm --publish 8000:8000 treeverse/lakefs:latest run --quickstart
```

After a few moments you should see the lakeFS container ready to use: 

```
