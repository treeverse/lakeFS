# lakeFS Quickstart

**Welcome to lakeFS üëãüèª** `:axolotl-waving:`
lakeFS provides a "git for data" platform enabling you to implement best practices from software engineering on your data lake, including branching and merging, CI/CD, and production-like dev/test environments. 

This quickstart will introduce you to some of the core ideas in lakeFS can do by illustrating the concept of branching, merging, and rolling back changes to data. It's laid out in five short sections: 

1. [**Launch**](launch.html) / Spin up the quickstart environment locally under Docker
1. [**Query** ](query.html) / Query the pre-populated data on the `main` branch
1. [**Branch**](create-branch.html) / Make changes to the data on a new branch
1. [**Merge**](commit-and-merge.html) / Merge the changed data back to the `main` branch
1. [**Rollback**](rollback.html) / Change our mind and revert the changes
