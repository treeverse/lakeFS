# Spin up the environment

!!! tip
    If you don't want to install lakeFS locally, you can use the [30-day free trial of lakeFS Cloud](https://lakefs.cloud/register). Once you launch the free trial you will have access to the same content as this quickstart within the provided repository once you login.

install and launch lakeFS:

```bash
pip install lakefs
python -m lakefs.quickstart
```

After a few moments you should see the lakeFS container ready to use: 

```text
