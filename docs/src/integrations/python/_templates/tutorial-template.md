```

## Overview

High-level overview of what we'll build, including:
- Architecture diagram (if applicable)
- Data flow description
- Key components

## Step-by-Step Implementation

### Step 1: Setup and Configuration

Description of the first step.

```python
# Complete code for step 1
import lakefs

# Setup code with explanations
client = lakefs.Client(...)
```

**What's happening:**
- Explanation of the code
- Why this step is necessary
- Key concepts introduced

### Step 2: [Next Major Step]

Description of the second step.

```python
# Complete code for step 2
# Build on previous steps
```

**Key Points:**
- Important concept from this step
- How it relates to previous steps
- Common pitfalls to avoid

### Step 3: [Continue with remaining steps]

[Continue pattern for all major steps]

## Complete Code

Provide the complete, working code for the entire tutorial:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
Complete tutorial implementation
"""

import lakefs
import pandas as pd
# Other imports

def main():
    """Main tutorial function"""
    # Complete implementation
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Testing Your Implementation

How to verify the tutorial works correctly:

```python
# Test code or verification steps

## Tutorial Guidelines

### Content Structure
1. **Clear Learning Objectives**: State what readers will accomplish
2. **Prerequisite Check**: Ensure readers have necessary background
3. **Progressive Complexity**: Start simple, build complexity gradually
4. **Complete Examples**: Every code snippet should be runnable
5. **Explanation**: Don't just show code, explain the reasoning
6. **Testing**: Include ways to verify the implementation works
7. **Troubleshooting**: Address common issues proactively

### Code Quality Standards
- All code must be tested and working
- Use realistic, meaningful examples
- Include proper error handling
- Follow Python best practices
- Use consistent variable naming
- Add comments for complex logic

### Writing Style
- Use second person ("you will", "your code")
- Be encouraging and supportive
- Explain concepts before showing code
- Use active voice
- Keep paragraphs concise
- Use bullet points for lists

### Visual Elements
- Include diagrams for complex concepts
- Use code blocks with syntax highlighting
- Add screenshots for UI elements (if applicable)
- Use callout boxes for important notes
