# Python Integration with lakeFS

lakeFS provides multiple Python integration options to suit different use cases and development patterns. This comprehensive guide helps you choose the right SDK and get started quickly.

!!! warning "Legacy SDK Deprecation"
    If your project is currently using the [legacy Python `lakefs-client`](https://pypi.org/project/lakefs-client/), please be aware that this version has been [deprecated](../posts/deprecate-py-legacy.md). As of release **v1.44.0**, it's no longer supported for new updates or features.

## SDK Architecture and Relationships

Understanding the relationship between different Python SDKs helps you make informed decisions:

- **High-Level SDK** is built on top of the **Generated SDK**, providing simplified interfaces while maintaining access to the underlying client
- **Generated SDK** provides direct access to all lakeFS API endpoints based on the OpenAPI specification
- **lakefs-spec** offers a filesystem-like interface compatible with the fsspec ecosystem
