## Decision Guidelines

### Choose High-Level SDK When:

- Building production applications with complex lakeFS workflows
- Need transaction support and advanced error handling
- Want comprehensive feature access with minimal code
- Team prefers high-level abstractions
- Building ETL pipelines or data management systems

```python
# Example: Complex workflow with transactions
import lakefs

client = lakefs.Client()
repo = client.repository("my-repo")

with repo.branch("feature").transaction() as tx:
    # Multiple operations in atomic transaction
    tx.upload("data/file1.csv", data1)
    tx.upload("data/file2.csv", data2)
    # Automatically commits or rolls back
```

### Choose Generated SDK When:

- Need access to specific API endpoints not covered by High-Level SDK
- Building microservices with minimal dependencies
- Require fine-grained control over API interactions
- Integrating with existing API client patterns
- Need async support for specific operations

```python
# Example: Direct API access for custom operations
from lakefs_sdk import LakeFSApi, Configuration

config = Configuration(host="http://localhost:8000")
api = LakeFSApi(config)

# Direct API call with full control
response = api.list_repositories(
    prefix="project-",
    amount=100,
    after="cursor"
)
```

### Choose lakefs-spec When:

- Working primarily with data science libraries
- Processing large datasets with streaming requirements
- Using Jupyter notebooks for analysis
- Need filesystem-like interface
- Integrating with existing fsspec-based workflows

```python
# Example: Data science workflow
import pandas as pd
import lakefs_spec

# Direct pandas integration
df = pd.read_parquet("lakefs://repo/branch/data/dataset.parquet")
processed_df = df.groupby("category").sum()
processed_df.to_parquet("lakefs://repo/branch/results/summary.parquet")
```

### Choose Boto3 When:

- Migrating existing S3-based applications
- Need S3 tool compatibility
- Simple object storage requirements
- Team has strong AWS expertise
- Using S3-compatible tools and libraries

```python
# Example: S3-compatible operations
import boto3

s3 = boto3.client('s3', endpoint_url='http://localhost:8000')
s3.put_object(
    Bucket='repo',
    Key='branch/path/to/file.txt',
    Body=data
)
```

## Migration Paths

### From S3 to lakeFS

1. **Start with Boto3**: Minimal code changes, immediate compatibility
2. **Add lakefs-spec**: For data science workflows requiring filesystem interface
3. **Upgrade to High-Level SDK**: For advanced lakeFS features and better integration

### From File Systems to lakeFS

1. **Start with lakefs-spec**: Familiar filesystem interface
2. **Add High-Level SDK**: For repository management and advanced features
3. **Consider Generated SDK**: For custom integrations and specific API needs

### Between lakeFS SDKs

- **Generated → High-Level**: Gradual migration, can access Generated SDK through High-Level
- **High-Level → Generated**: For specific API access, use `client.sdk` property
- **Any SDK → lakefs-spec**: For data science workflows, can run in parallel
