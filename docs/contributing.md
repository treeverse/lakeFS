## Setting up an Environment

*This section was tested on macOS and Linux (Fedora 32, Ubuntu 20.04) - Your mileage may vary*

1. Install the required dependencies for your OS:
    1. [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
    1. [GNU make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) (probably best to install from your OS package manager such as apt or brew)
    1. [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
    1. [Go 1.14](https://golang.org/doc/install)
    1. [Node.js & npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)
    1. *Optional* - [PostgreSQL 11](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/11/tutorial-install.html) (useful for running and debugging locally)
1. Install statik:
   
   ```shell
   go get github.com/rakyll/statik 
   ```
   
   Make sure `(go env GOPATH)/bin` is in your `$PATH` (or at least, that the `statik` binary is). 
   
1. Clone the repository from https://github.com/treeverse/lakeFS
1. Build the project:
   
   ```shell
   make build
   ```
   
1. Make sure tests are passing:
   
   ```shell
   make test 
   ```

## Before creating a pull request

1. Review this document in full
1. Make sure there's an open issue on Github that this pull request addresses, and that it isn't labeled `WONT-FIX`
1. Fork the [lakeFS repository](https://github.com/treeverse/lakeFS)
1. If you're adding new functionality, create a new branch named `feature/<DESCRIPTIVE NAME>`
1. If you're fixing a bug, create a new branch named `fix/<DESCRIPTIVE NAME>-<ISSUE NUMBER>`

## Creating a pull request

Once you've made the necessary changes to the code, make sure tests pass:

   ```shell
   make test 
   ```

Check linting rules are passing:

   ```shell
   make checks-validator
   ```

lakeFS uses [go fmt](https://golang.org/cmd/gofmt/) as a style guide for Go code.


## After submitting your pull request

After submitting your pull request, [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/treeverse/lakeFS/actions) will automatically run tests on your changes and make sure that your updated code builds and runs on Go 1.14.

Check back shortly after submitting your pull request to make sure that your code passes these checks. If any of the checks come back with a red X, then do your best to address the errors.
