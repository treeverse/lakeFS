# Prepare Your Storage

A production installation of lakeFS will usually use your cloud provider's object storage as the underlying storage layer.
You can choose to create a new bucket/container (recommended), or use an existing one with a path prefix.
The path under the existing bucket/container should be empty.

Once you have a bucket/container configured, proceed to [Deploying lakeFS](../deploy/index.md).

Choose your storage provider to configure your storage.
