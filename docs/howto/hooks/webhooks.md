# Webhooks

{% include toc.html %}

A Webhook is a Hook type that sends an HTTP POST request to the configured URL.
Any non 2XX response by the responding endpoint will fail the Hook, cancel the execution of the following Hooks
under the same Action. For `pre-*` hooks, the triggering operation will also be aborted.

**Warning:** You should not use `pre-*` webhooks for long-running tasks, since they block the performed operation.
Moreover, the branch is locked during the execution of `pre-*` hooks, so the webhook server cannot perform any write operations on the branch (like uploading or commits).

## Action File Webhook properties

_See the [Action configuration](./index.md#action-file) for overall configuration schema and details._

| Property     | Description                                            | Data Type                                                                                 | Required | Default Value | Env Vars Support |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|---------------|------------------|
| url          | The URL address of the request                         | String                                                                                    | true     |               | no               |
| timeout      | Time to wait for response before failing the hook      | String (golang's [Duration](https://golang.org/pkg/time/#Duration.String) representation) | false    | 1 minute      | no               |
| query_params | List of query params that will be added to the request | Dictionary(String:String or String:List(String)                                           | false    |               | yes              |
| headers      | Headers to add to the request                          | Dictionary(String:String)                                                                 | false    |               | yes              |

**Secrets & Environment Variables**<br/>
lakeFS Actions supports secrets by using environment variables.
The format `{% raw %}{{{% endraw %} ENV.SOME_ENV_VAR {% raw %}}}{% endraw %}` will be replaced with the value of `$SOME_ENV_VAR`
during the execution of the action. If that environment variable doesn't exist in the lakeFS server environment, the action run will fail.

For security purposes, any environment variable whose name begins with "LAKEFS" will be blocked. In this case, the variable will be evaluated to an empty string, effectively making it inaccessible.
Additionally, the `actions.env.enabled` configuration parameter can be set to `false` to block access to all environment variables.

Example:

```yaml
...
hooks:
  - id: prevent_user_columns
    type: webhook
    description: Ensure no user_* columns under public/
    properties:
      url: "http://<host:port>/webhooks/schema"
      timeout: 1m30s
      query_params:
        disallow: ["user_", "private_"]
        prefix: public/
      headers:
        secret_header: "{% raw %}{{{% endraw %} ENV.MY_SECRET {% raw %}}}{% endraw %}"
...
```
