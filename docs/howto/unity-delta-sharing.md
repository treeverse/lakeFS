## Introduction

lakeFS Unity Delta Sharing provides a read-only experience from Unity Catalog for lakeFS customers.  Currently, this is available as a private
preview.  It provides _full read-only functionality_ for Unity Catalog.  It does _not_ provide a "self-service" experience to set up the service.

## Setup

This guide explains how to set up and use lakeFS Delta Sharing.  Currently, you will have to configure lakeFS Delta Sharing in collaboration with
Treeverse Customer Success.  Once set up is complete, you will of course be able to use lakeFS Delta Sharing on existing and on new tables without
further assistance.

### 1. Collect data and initial setup

* Select a `Delta Sharing configuration URL`.  This is a single location on lakeFS to hold the top-level configuration of lakeFS Delta Sharing across all
  repositories of your organization.  Typically, it will have the form `lakefs://REPO/main/lakefs_delta_sharing.yaml` for one of your
  repositories.  A longer path may be supplied - however, we do recommend keeping it on the `main` branch, as this object represents state
  for the entire installation.

* Create a user `lakefs-delta-sharing-service` for lakeFS Delta Sharing, and an access key for that user.  It should have at least read permissions for
  the configuration URL and for all repositories and all data accesses by Unity.  lakeFS Delta Sharing will these credentials to communicate with lakeFS.

**Communicate these items to Customer Success**:

* Configuration URL
* Access key ID and secret access key for user `lakefs-delta-sharing-service`.

Note: All YAML files extensions used in this guide must be `yaml`. Do not use a `yml` extension instead.

### 2. Initial configuration

Select a secret authorization token to share Unity catalog.  Unity catalog will use to authenticate to the lakeFS Delta Sharing server.  
You might use this command on Linux:

```sh
head -c 50 /dev/random | base64
```

Create a file `lakefs_delta_sharing.yaml` and place it at the config URL selected above.  It should look like this:

```yaml
authorization_token: "GENERATED TOKEN"
# Map lakeFS repositories to Unity shares
repositories:
    - id: sample-repo
      share_name: undev
      # List branches and prefixes to export.  Each of these branches (and only
      # these branches) will be available as a schema on Unity.
      branches:
          - main
          - staging
          - dev_*
    - id: repo2
      share_name: share_two
      branches:
      - "*"
```

Note that a plain "*" line must be quoted in YAML.

Upload it to your config URL.  For instance if the config URL is `lakefs://repo/main/lakefs_delta_sharing.yaml`, you might use:

```sh
lakectl fs upload -s ./lakefs_delta_sharing.yaml lakefs://repo/main/lakefs_delta_sharing.yaml
```

### 3. Connect Unity to lakeFS Delta Sharing!

You now need to configure Unity to use the lakeFS Delta Sharing server. Create a share provider file `config.share.json`; see the [Delta Sharing manual][databricks-delta-sharing]:

   ```json
   {
     "shareCredentialsVersion": 1,
     "endpoint": "https://ORG_ID.REGION.lakefscloud.io/service/delta-sharing/v1",
     "bearerToken": "GENERATED TOKEN",
     "expirationTime": "2030-01-01T00:00:00.0Z"
   }
   ```

"GENERATED TOKEN" is the secret authorization token use above.

Install the [databricks cli][databricks-cli].  We will use it to create Delta Share on Unity.  Follow the
[instructions](https://docs.databricks.com/dev-tools/cli/index.html#set-up-authentication-using-a-databricks-personal-access-token) to configure it.

Run the provider creation command:
   ```shell
   databricks unity-catalog providers create \
       --name lakefs-cloud \
       --recipient-profile-json-file config.share.json
   ```

Go to "Data >> Delta Sharing" on the DataBricks environment.  Once Treeverse have configured lakeFS Delta Sharing on your account with your config URL,
the "lakefs-cloud" provider should appear under "Shared with me".

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/unity-delta-sharing-provider.png" alt="lakeFS-Cloud provider appearing on DataBricks Delta Sharing / Shared with me" class="quickstart"/>

Click the provider to see its shares.

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/unity-delta-sharing-shares.png" alt="lakeFS-Cloud provider, showing share and create catalog" class="quickstart"/>

You can now create a catalog from these shares.

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/unity-delta-sharing-create-catalog.png" alt="lakeFS-Cloud provider, create catalog from share" class="quickstart"/>

And you can see schemas for each of the branches that you configured in the share.  Here branch name `dev_experiment1` matches the pattern `dev_*` that
we defined in the configuration object `lakefs-delta-sharing.yaml`, so it appears as a schema.

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/unity-delta-sharing-schema-per-branch.png" alt="lakeFS-Cloud provider, every configured branch is a schema" class="quickstart"/>

At this point you have configured Delta Sharing on lakeFS, and DataBricks to communicate with lakeFS delta sharing.  No further Treeverse involvement is required.  
Updates to `lakefs_delta_sharing.yaml` will update within a minute of uploading a new version.

### 4. Configure tables

Everything is ready: lakeFS repositories are configured as shares, and branches are configured as schemas.  Now you can define tables!  Once a
repository is shared, its tables are configured as a table descriptor object on the repository on the path `_lakefs_tables/TABLE.yaml`.

#### Delta Lake tables

Delta Lake format includes full metadata, so you only need to configure the prefix:

```yaml
name: users
type: delta
path: path/to/users/
```

Note: The filename of the 'yaml' file containing the table definition must match the 'name' of the table itself. In the example above, '_lakefs_tables/users.yaml'.
{: .note }

When placed inside `_lakefs_tables/users.yaml` this defines a table `users` on the prefix `path/to/users/` (so `path/to/users/` holds the prefix `_delta_log`).

#### Hive tables

Hive metadata server tables are essentially just a set of objects that share a prefix, with no table metadata stored on the object store.  You need to configure prefix, partitions, and schema.

```yaml
name: clicks
type: hive
path: path/to/clicks/
partition_columns: ['year']
schema:
  type: struct
  fields:
    - name: year
      type: integer
      nullable: false
      metadata: {}
    - name: page
      type: string
      nullable: false
      metadata: {}
    - name: site
      type: string
      nullable: true
      metadata:
        comment: a comment about this column
```

Useful types recognized by DataBricks Photon include `integer`, `long`, `short`, `string`, `double`, `float`, `date`, and `timestamp`.  
For exact type mappings, and whether to specify a field as `nullable: false`, refer to [DataBricks Photon documentation][databricks-photon-types].
