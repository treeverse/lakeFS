## Installation and upgrades

* Step-by-step instructions for deploying and configuring lakeFS on [AWS](/howto/deploy/aws.html), [GCP](/howto/deploy/gcp.html), [Azure](/howto/deploy/azure.html), and [on-premises](/howto/deploy/onprem.html). 

* Details on [how to upgrade lakeFS](/howto/deploy/upgrade.html)

## Getting data in and out of lakeFS

* [Import](/howto/import.html) and [Export Data](/howto/export.html) from lakeFS
* [Copy data](/howto/copying.html) to/from lakeFS
* [Using external Data Catalogs](/howto/catalog_exports.html) with data stored on lakeFS
* [Migrating](/howto/migrate-away.html) away from lakeFS

## Actions and Hooks in lakeFS

* Use [Actions and Hooks](/howto/hooks/) as part of your workflow to validate data, enforce constraints, and do more when events occur.

## Branch Protection

* [Branch Protection](/howto/protect-branches.html) prevents commits directly to a branch. This is a good way to enforce good practice and make sure that changes to important branches are only done by a merge.

## lakeFS Sizing Guide

* This [comprehensive guide](/howto/sizing-guide.html) details all you need to know to correctly size and test your lakeFS deployment for production use at scale, including: 

    * [System Requirements](/howto/sizing-guide.html#system-requirements)
    * [Scaling factors](/howto/sizing-guide.html#scaling-factors)
    * [Benchmarks](/howto/sizing-guide.html#benchmarks)
    * [Important metrics](/howto/sizing-guide.html#important-metrics)
    * [Reference architectures](/howto/sizing-guide.html#reference-architectures)

## Garbage Collection

* lakeFS will keep all of your objects forever, unless you tell it otherwise. Use [Garbage Collection]({% link howto/garbage-collection/index.md %}) (GC) to remove objects from the underlying storage.
    If you want GC to happen automagically then you can use [Managed Garbage Collection]({% link howto/garbage-collection/managed-gc.md %}) which is available as part of lakeFS Cloud.

## Private Link

* [Private Link]({% link howto/private-link.md %}) enables lakeFS Cloud to interact with your infrastructure using private networking.

## Unity Delta Sharing

* lakeFS [Unity Delta Sharing]({% link howto/unity-delta-sharing.md %}) provides a read-only experience from Unity Catalog for lakeFS customers.
