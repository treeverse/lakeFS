# Deploy and Setup lakeFS

{: .tip }
> The instructions given here are for a self-managed deployment of lakeFS. 
> 
> For a hosted lakeFS service with guaranteed SLAs, try [lakeFS Cloud](https://lakefs.cloud)

This section will guide you through deploying lakeFS on top of an object store. You will require a database, and can optionally configure authentication using providers specific to your deployment platform. 

Which options are available depends on your deployment platform. For example, the object store available on Azure differs from that on AWS.
