_This section describes how to import existing data into a lakeFS repository, without copying it.
If you are interested in copying data into lakeFS, see [Copying data to/from lakeFS](./copying.md)._

# Importing data into lakeFS
{: .mt-2 }

{% include toc_2-3.html %}

## Prerequisites

* Importing is permitted for users in the Supers (lakeFS open-source) group or the SuperUsers (lakeFS Cloud/Enterprise) group.
   To learn how lakeFS Cloud and lakeFS Enterprise users can fine-tune import permissions, see [Fine-grained permissions](#fine-grained-permissions) below.
* The lakeFS _server_ must have permissions to list the objects in the source bucket.
* The source bucket must be in the same region as your repository.

## Using the lakeFS UI

1. In your repository's main page, click the _Import_ button to open the import dialog.
2. Under _Import from_, fill in the location on your object store you would like to import from.
3. Fill in the import destination in lakeFS. This should be a path under the current branch.
4. Add a commit message, and optionally commit metadata.
5. Press _Import_.

Once the import is complete, a new commit containing the imported objects will be created in the destination branch.

## Using the CLI: _lakectl import_
The _lakectl import_ command acts the same as the UI import wizard. It commits the changes to the selected branch.

</ul>

## Notes
{:.no_toc}

1. Any previously existing objects under the destination prefix will be deleted.
1. The import duration depends on the amount of imported objects, but will roughly be a few thousand objects per second.
1. Importing is only possible from the object storage service in which your installation stores its data. For example, if lakeFS is configured to use S3, you cannot import data from Azure.
1. For security reasons, if you are using lakeFS on top of your local disk (`blockstore.type=local`), you need to enable the import feature explicitly. 
   To do so, set the `blockstore.local.import_enabled` to `true` and specify the allowed import paths in `blockstore.local.allowed_external_prefixes` (see [configuration reference]({% link reference/configuration.md %})).
   Since there are some differences between object-stores and file-systems in the way directories/prefixes are treated, local import is allowed only for directories. 
1. Making changes to data in the original bucket will not be reflected in lakeFS, and may cause inconsistencies. 

## Fine-grained permissions
{:.no_toc}
{: .d-inline-block }
lakeFS Cloud
{: .label .label-green }
lakeFS Enterprise
{: .label .label-purple }

With RBAC support, The lakeFS user running the import command should have the following permissions in lakeFS:
`fs:WriteObject`, `fs:CreateMetaRange`, `fs:CreateCommit`, `fs:ImportFromStorage` and `fs:ImportCancel`.

As mentioned above, all of these permissions are available by default to the Supers (lakeFS open-source) group or the SuperUsers (lakeFS Cloud/Enterprise).

## Provider-specific permissions
{:.no_toc}

In addition, the following for provider-specific permissions may be required:

<div class="tabs">
<ul>
  <li><a href="#aws-s3">AWS S3</a></li>
  <li><a href="#azure-storage">Azure Storage</a></li>
  <li><a href="#gcs">Google Cloud Storage</a></li>
</ul>

## AWS S3: Importing from public buckets
{:.no_toc}

lakeFS needs access to the imported location to first list the files to import and later read the files upon users request.

There are some use cases where the user would like to import from a destination which isn't owned by the account running lakeFS.
For example, importing public datasets to experiment with lakeFS and Spark.

lakeFS will require additional permissions to read from public buckets. For example, for S3 public buckets,
the following policy needs to be attached to the lakeFS S3 service-account to allow access to public buckets, while blocking access to other owned buckets:

  ```json
   {
     "Version": "2012-10-17",
     "Statement": [
       {
         "Sid": "PubliclyAccessibleBuckets",
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Action": [
            "s3:GetBucketVersioning",
            "s3:ListBucket",
            "s3:GetBucketLocation",
            "s3:ListBucketMultipartUploads",
            "s3:ListBucketVersions",
            "s3:GetObject",
            "s3:GetObjectVersion",
            "s3:AbortMultipartUpload",
            "s3:ListMultipartUploadParts"
         ],
         "Resource": ["*"],
         "Condition": {
           "StringNotEquals": {
             "s3:ResourceAccount": "<YourAccountID>"
           }
         }
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

### Azure Data Lake Gen2
{:.no_toc}

lakeFS requires a hint in the import source URL to understand that the provided storage account is ADLS Gen2

```
   For source account URL:
      https://<my-account>.core.windows.net/path/to/import/

   Please add the *adls* subdomain to the URL as follows:
      https://<my-account>.adls.core.windows.net/path/to/import/
```
