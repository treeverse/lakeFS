## What is lakeFS
{: .no_toc }

lakeFS transforms object storage buckets into data lake repositories that
expose a Git-like interface.  By design, it works with data of any size.

The Git-like interface means users of lakeFS can use the same development
workflows for code and data.  Git workflows greatly improved software
development practices; we designed lakeFS to bring the same benefits to
data.

In this way, lakeFS brings a unique combination of performance and manageability to data lakes. *To learn more about applying Git principles to data, [see here](https://lakefs.io/how-to-manage-your-data-the-way-you-manage-your-code/).*

The open source lakeFS project supports AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage and Google Cloud Storage (GCS) as its underlying storage service. It is API compatible with S3 and integrates seamlessly with popular data frameworks such as Spark, Hive, dbt, Trino, and many others.

## New! lakeFS Playground

Experience lakeFS first hand with your own isolated environment.
You can easily integrate it with your existing tools, and feel lakeFS in action in an environment similar to your own.

## How do I use lakeFS?

lakeFS maintains compatibility with the S3 API to minimize adoption
friction.  Use it as a drop-in replacement for S3 from the perspective of
any tool interacting with a data lake.

For example, take the common operation of reading a collection of data from object storage into a Spark DataFrame. For data outside a lakeFS repo, the code will look like:

```py
df = spark.read.parquet("s3a://my-bucket/collections/foo/")
```

After adding the data collections in my-bucket to a repository, the same operation becomes:

```py
df = spark.read.parquet("s3a://my-repo/main-branch/collections/foo/")
```

You can use the same methods and syntax you already use to read and write data when using a lakeFS repository.  This simplifies adoption of lakeFS: minimal changes are needed to get started, making further changes an incremental process.


## Why is lakeFS the data solution you've been missing?

Working with data in a lakeFS repository &mdash; as opposed to a bucket &mdash; enables simplified workflows when developing data lake pipelines.

lakeFS performs all these operations safely and efficiently:

* **Copying objects between prefixes to promote new data**
* **Deleting specific objects to recover from data errors**
* **Maintaining auxilliary jobs that populate a development environment with data**

If today you spend time performing any of these actions, adopting lakeFS
will speed up your development and deployment cycles, reduce the chance of
incorrect data making it into production, and make recovery less painful if it does.

Through its versioning engine, lakeFS enables the following built-in operations familiar from Git:

* **branch:** a consistent copy of a repository, isolated from other branches and their changes. Initial creation of a branch is a metadata operation that does not duplicate objects.
* **commit:** an immutable checkpoint containing a complete snapshot of a repository.
* **merge:** performed between two branches &mdash; merges atomically update one branch with the changes from another.
* **revert:** return a repo to the exact state of a previous commit.
* **tag:** a pointer to a single immutable commit with a readable, meaningful name.

*See the [object model](./understand/model.md) for an in-depth
definition of these,and the [CLI reference](./reference/commands.md) for the
full list of commands.*

Incorporating these operations into your data lake pipelines provides the same collaboration and organizational benefits you get when managing application code with source control.

### The lakeFS promotion workflow

Here's how lakeFS *branches* and *merges* improve the universal process of updating collections with the latest data.

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/promotion_workflow.png" alt="lakeFS promotion workflow" width="60%" height="60%" />

1. First, create a new **branch** from `main` to instantly generate a complete "copy" of your production data.
2. Apply changes or make updates on the isolated branch to understand their impact prior to exposure.
3. And finally, perform a **merge** from the feature branch back to main to atomically promote the updates into production.

Following this pattern, lakeFS facilitates a streamlined data deployment workflow that consistently produces data assets you can have total confidence in.

## What else does lakeFS do?

lakeFS helps you maintain a tidy data lake in several other ways, including:

#### Recovery from data errors

Human error, misconfiguration, or wide-ranging systematic effects are
unavoidable.  When they do happen, erroneous data may make it into
production, or critical data assets might accidentally by deleted.

By their nature, backups are the wrong tool for recovering from such events.
Backups are periodic events that are usually not tied to performing
erroneous operations.  So they may be out of date, and they will require
sifting through data at the object level.  This process is inefficient and
can take hours, days, or in some cases, weeks to complete.  By quickly
committing entire snapshots of data at well-defined times, recovering data
in deletion or corruption events becomes an instant one-line operation with
lakeFS: just identify a good historical commit, and then restore to it or
copy from it.

Reverting your data lake back to previous version using our command-line tool is explained [here](https://docs.lakefs.io/reference/commands.html#lakectl-branch-revert).

#### Data reprocessing and backfills

Occasionally, we might need to reprocess historical data. This can be due to several reasons:

* Implementing new logic.
* Late arriving data that wasnâ€™t included in previous analysis, and need to be backfilled after the fact.

This is tricky first and foremost because it often involves huge volumes of historical data. In addition, auditing requirements may necessitate keeping the old version of the data.

lakeFS allows you to manage the reprocess on an isolated branch before merging to ensure the reprocessed data is exposed atomically. It also allows you to easily access the different versions of reprocessed data, using any tag or a historical commit ID.

#### Cross-collection consistency guarantees

Data engineers typically need to implement custom logic in scripts to guarantee
two or more data assets are updated synchronously.  This logic often
requires extensive rewrites or periods during which data is unavailable.
The lakeFS merge operation from one branch into another removes the need to
implement this logic yourself.

Instead, make updates to the desired data assets on a branch, and then utilize a lakeFS merge to atomically expose the data to downstream consumers.

To learn more about atomic cross-collection updates, [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OsjUvk5UJU) describes the concept in more detail.

#### Troubleshooting production problems

Data engineers are often asked to validate the data. A user might report inconsistencies, question the accuracy, or simply report it to be incorrect. Since the data continuously changes, it is challenging to understand its state at the time of the error.

The best way to investigate, therefore, is to have a snapshot of the data as close as possible to the time of the error.
Once implementing a regular commit cadence in lakeFS, each commit represents an accessible historical snapshot of the data. When needed, a branch may be created from a commit ID to debug an issue in isolation.

To learn more on how to access a specific historical commit in a repository, see our seminal post on [data reproducibility](https://lakefs.io/solving-data-reproducibility/).

#### Establishing data quality guarantees

The best way to deal with mistakes is to avoid them. A data source that is ingested into the lake introducing low-quality data should be blocked before exposure if possible.

With lakeFS, you can achieve this by tying data quality tests to commit and merge operations via lakeFS [hooks](./setup/hooks.md).
