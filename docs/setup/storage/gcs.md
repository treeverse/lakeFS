# Prepare Your GCS Bucket

1. On the Google Cloud Storage console, click *Create Bucket*. Follow the instructions.

1. In the *Permissions* tab, add the service account with which you intend to use lakeFS. Give it a role that allows reading and writing to the bucket, e.g., *Storage Object Creator*.

You're now ready to [create your first lakeFS repository](../create-repo.md).
