# Prepare Your AWS S3 Bucket

1. From the S3 Administration console, choose _Create Bucket_.
2. Make sure that you block public access and disable object lock.
3. Use the following as your bucket policy, filling in the placeholders:

```json
{
   "Id": "lakeFSPolicy",
   "Version": "2012-10-17",
   "Statement": [
      {
         "Sid": "lakeFSObjects",
         "Action": [
            "s3:GetObject",
            "s3:PutObject",
            "s3:AbortMultipartUpload",
            "s3:ListMultipartUploadParts"
         ],
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Resource": ["arn:aws:s3:::<BUCKET_NAME_AND_PREFIX>/*"],
         "Principal": {
            "AWS": ["arn:aws:iam::<ACCOUNT_ID>:role/<IAM_ROLE>"]
         }
      },
      {
         "Sid": "lakeFSBucket",
         "Action": [
            "s3:ListBucket",
            "s3:GetBucketLocation",
            "s3:ListBucketMultipartUploads"
         ],
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Resource": ["arn:aws:s3:::<BUCKET>"],
         "Principal": {
            "AWS": ["arn:aws:iam::<ACCOUNT_ID>:role/<IAM_ROLE>"]
         }
      }
   ]
}
```
* Replace `<BUCKET_NAME>`, `<ACCOUNT_ID>` and `<IAM_ROLE>` with values relevant to your environment.
* `<BUCKET_NAME_AND_PREFIX>` can be the bucket name. If you want to minimize the bucket policy permissions, use the bucket name together with a prefix (e.g. `example-bucket/a/b/c`).
   This way, lakeFS will be able to create repositories only under this specific path (see: [Storage Namespace](../../glossary.md#storage-namespace)).
* lakeFS will try to assume the role `<IAM_ROLE>`.

### Alternative: use an AWS user

lakeFS can authenticate with your AWS account using an AWS user, using an access key and secret. To allow this, change the policy's Principal accordingly:
```json
 "Principal": {
   "AWS": ["arn:aws:iam::<ACCOUNT_ID>:user/<IAM_USER>"]
 }
```


### Advanced: minimal permissions

lakeFS requires permissions to access the `_lakefs` prefix under your storage namespace, in which the metadata
objects are stored ([learn more](../../understand/versioning-internals.md#constructing-a-consistent-view-of-the-keyspace-ie-a-commit)).  
By setting this policy you'll be able to perform only metadata operations through lakeFS, meaning that you'll **not** be able
to use lakeFS to upload or download objects. Specifically you won't be able to:
* Upload objects using the lakeFS GUI
* Upload objects through Spark using the S3 gateway
* Run `lakectl fs` commands (unless using the `--direct` flag)

This permission is useful if you upload/download objects to/from your bucket using external tools.
For example, you can use the [lakeFS Hadoop FileSystem Spark integration](../../integrations/spark.md#access-lakefs-using-the-lakefs-specific-hadoop-filesystem)
to directly access your S3 bucket while performing metadata operations through lakeFS on the objects in that bucket.

```json
{
  "Id": "<POLICY_ID>",
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "lakeFSObjects",
      "Action": [
         "s3:GetObject",
         "s3:PutObject"
      ],
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Resource": [
         "arn:aws:s3:::<STORAGE_NAMESPACE>/_lakefs/*"
      ],
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": ["arn:aws:iam::<ACCOUNT_ID>:role/<IAM_ROLE>"]
      }
    },
     {
        "Sid": "lakeFSBucket",
        "Action": [
           "s3:ListBucket",
           "s3:GetBucketLocation"
        ],
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Resource": ["arn:aws:s3:::<BUCKET>"],
        "Principal": {
           "AWS": ["arn:aws:iam::<ACCOUNT_ID>:role/<IAM_ROLE>"]
        }
     }
  ]
}
```
