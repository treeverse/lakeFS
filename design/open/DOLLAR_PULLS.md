# $PULLS Proposal

This proposal tries to bridge between two proposals: [pull-request](pull-request.md) and [checks](https://github.com/treeverse/lakeFS/blob/280c5b741df5e1e051958b8adde826364c6df614/design/open/branch_checks.md)
and provide long-running CI/CD processes while laying the foundation for future "pull-request" like feature.

## Goals

* Allow long CI/CD processes
* Enable branch protection feature for merge 

## Non-Goals

* Collaboration
  * Reviews / change requests
  * Discussions
  * Approvals
* Required actions

## Suggestion 1: Pull Requests

### How it will work

Introduce a new entity called $PULLS at the repository level. The $PULLS entity is identified by a source branch and destination branch. 
Each source-destination pair can have only a single `OPEN` $PULLS instance.
Define a new hook type - `on-pull` which will run whenever a new $PULLS instance is created.
The actions will run on the source branch, and will allow merging after job is successful.

#### $PULLS Object

$PULLS will be saved in the ref-store under the key: 
`$PULLS/<src-branch>/<dest-branch>/<$PULLS-id>`

The $PULLS object will contain the following data:

* `Source Branch`
* `Source Ref` - The source branch head at the time of creation
* `Destination Branch`
* `Run ID` - The actions associated run id, may be empty

#### $PULLS States

$PULLS will have the following states:

* `OPEN`
* `CLOSED`
* `MERGED`

#### Creating a new $PULLS instance

POST `/api/v1/repositories/{repository}/branches/{sourceBranch}/$PULLS/{destinationBranch}`

On creation the following occurs:

1. Check for conflicts between source and destination branch - if conflict is found, do not run actions and display an appropriate message
2. Run actions - and associate RunID with instance

This will return the $PULLS instance ID, that can be used later for querying and merging etc.

#### Querying $PULLS

GET `/api/v1/repositories/{repository}/branches/{sourceBranch}/$PULLS/{destinationBranch}/{id}`

Will return the status, corresponding actions RunID

#### Delete $PULLS

DELETE `/api/v1/repositories/{repository}/branches/{sourceBranch}/$PULLS/{destinationBranch}/{id}`

#### $PULLS enforcement

Enforcement will be done in the repository level - using the branch protection rules.
Define a new rule `BranchProtection_RequirePull` which when set, will prohibit merge into branch not via a $PULLS instance.

#### Merge $PULLS

Add an optional parameter to the Merge API for the $PULLS id. 
When performing a merge with a $PULLS id, perform the following preliminary checks:
1. Verify source reference id with source branch head
2. Verify actions run successful
3. Attempt to perform merge (Subject to failure on conflict / hooks)
4. Upon successful merge - change $PULLS state to `MERGED`
5. On the event of failure in any of the previous steps - provide a meaningful error

#### Re-run Actions

PUT `/api/v1/repositories/{repository}/branches/{sourceBranch}/$PULLS/{destinationBranch}/{id}`

In the event of failed actions run, it will be possible to re-run the job via the $PULLS context.
This will in fact - create a new trigger for the `on-pull` hook, and update the $PULLS instance with a new run ID.
By "re-running" the actions via the $PULLS, we are able to decouple the $PULLS feature from the hooks re-run requirement,
which can be implemented in the future.


### Required Changes

#### Branch Protection

* Add new branch protection rule for $PULLS
* Modify relevant APIs and add check for $PULLS branch protection rule
* UI: On Add, provide options to select rules. Allow editing of rules.

#### Merge

* Add checks for $PULLS state

#### Actions

* Add a new hook type: `on-pull`
* Implement asynchronous (pollable) hooks
* Implement hooks re-run

### UI

Introduce a new tab called $PULLS, that lists all the repository's $PULLS and their states.

From this view, it will be possible to create new $PULLS, re-run failed $PULLS and perform merge on successful $PULLS.

## Suggestion 2 (**ACCEPTED**): Keep it minimal - Manual Triggers 

### How it will work

Introduce a new trigger type to lakeFS actions: `manual-trigger`.
Once defined in a lakeFS action, it will be possible to trigger the action 
manually with a mandatory reference (branch/commit/tag).The lakeFS action 
will run on the provided reference and the results will be available in the 
just like any other action run.

A branch protection rule will be added to the repository level, that will 
enforce actions to be run on the source ref before merge.

### Required Changes

#### Branch Protection

* Add new branch protection rule for $ACTION_RUN
* Modify relevant APIs and add check for $ACTION_RUN branch protection rule
* UI: On Add, provide options to select rules. Allow editing of rules.

#### Merge

* Add checks for Branch Protection rule fulfillment.

#### Actions

* Add a new trigger type: `manual-trigger`
* Add an API endpoint for triggering actions:
POST `/repositories/{repository}/refs/{ref}/actions/{action}/trigger`
The request will execute the action on the provided ref if it exists on the 
  ref and one of the action triggers is `manual-trigger`. Otherwise, it will 
  fail with BadRequest. The request will not wait for the hook execution to 
  complete.

Open questions:
* Should hook re-run be implemented at first?
  * We can get away with not implementing it, and implement it in the future.
    It means that reruns would occur by pushing a new commit to the source 
    branch. Not ideal, but reruns are mostly useful for transient failures.
    *Decision*: Start without.
* Should asynchronous (pollable) hooks be implemented at first? 
  * Since the HTTP request doesn't wait for the action run to complete, we 
    can get away with not implementing it, and implement it in the future.
    By decoupling the hook execution from the context of a lakeFS operation 
    (pre-merge, pre-commit, etc.), we can now run as long as we want without 
    blocking anything. This means that we can run long CI/CD processes, and 
    possibly just log that the action is running.
    *Decision*: Implement for the first step.
