# Task management API: requirements

Multiple subsystems require reliable long-lived distributed operations.  We shall support them
with a task queue subsystem.  Concepts of the API are intended to parallel concepts in the
[Celery][celery-api] and/or [Machinery][machinery-api] APIs.  We do not use either of them to
reduce the number of required dependencies.  A future version may support external queues to
achieve better performance or robustness, at the price of increased ops or cost.  These will
likely be queues such as Kafka or SQS rather than full Celery or Machinery.

In practice this generally means providing APIs similar to those of Machinery (which is more
Go-like than Celery) for constructing task flows and for registering workers.

In particular:
1. We provide similar concepts for building task flows as do existing
   task queues.
1. We use similar terminology.
1. We do *not* require the entire API of an existing task queue.
1. We do *not* use the verbs or API calls of an existing task queue.

This API definition comes with implementation sketches for how we to use these APIs to implement
the branch export and concurrent dedupe "user" stories.

## API

### Concepts

#### Tasks

A task is the basic atom of task management.  It represents a single unit of work to
perform, and can succeed or fail.  Tasks may be retried on failure, so _executing a task
must be idempotent_.

Tasks connect to application code via an action and a body.  The _action_ identifies the
operation to complete these task.  Examples of actions can include "copy a file", "delete a
path", "report success".  It is essentially the _name_ of a procedure to perform at some future
time.  The _body_ of a task gives information necessary to configure the specific task.
Examples of bodies can include "source file path X, destination path Z" (for a copy task), "path
Z" (for a delete task), or "date started, number of objects and a message" (for a report task).
It essentially holds the _parameters_ the action uses to perform the task.

Tasks include these attributes:
- `Id`: a unique identifier for the task.  Use a known-unique substring in the identifier
  (e.g. a UUID or [nanoid][nanoid]) to avoid collisions, or a well-known identifier to ensure
  only one task of a type can exist.
- `Action`: the type of action to perform for this task.  Workers pick tasks to perform and the
  actions to perform on them according to this field.
- `Body`: a description of parameters for this text.  E.g. in a "copy file" task the body might
  specify source key, ETag and destination key.
- `StatusCode`: the internally-used state of the task in its lifecycle, see [life of a
  task](#life-of-a-task) below.
- `Status`: a textual description of the current status, generated by application code.
- `ToSignal`: an array of task IDs that cannot start before this task ends, and will therefore
  be signalled when it does.
- `NumSignals`: number of tasks that must signal this task before it can be performed.
  Initially equal to the number of tasks on which it appears in the `ToSignal` array.
- `MaxTries`: the maximal number of times to try to execute the task if it keeps being returned
  to state `pending`.
- `ActorId`: the unique string identifier chosen by a worker which is currently performing the
  task.  Useful for monitoring.
- `ActionDeadline`: a time by which the worker currently performing the task has committed to
  finish it.

Tasks provide these additional facilities (and include fields not listed here to support them):
- **Retries**.  A task repeatedly placed back into state `pending` will not be retried again.
- **Dependencies**.  Every task can only occur after some other tasks
  are done.

A task is performed by a single worker; if that worker does not finish processing it and an
action deadline was set, it will be given to another worker.

#### Life of a task

```
                     |
                     | InsertTasks
                     |
                     |
               +-----v-----+
           +-->|  pending  |
           |   +-----+-----+
 ReturnTask|         |
 (to       |         | OwnTasks
 pending)  |         |
           |   +-----v-----+
           +---+in-progress|
               +-----------+
                     |
        +------------+------------+      ReturnTask
        |                         |
   +----v---+                +----v----+
   |aborted |                |completed|
   +--------+                +---------+
```

A task arrives complete with dependencies, a count of the number of preceding tasks that
must "signal" it before it may be executed.  When the task completes it signals all of its
dependent tasks.

Tasks are inserted in state `pending`.  Multiple workers call `OwnTasks` to get tasks.  A
task may only be claimed by a call to `OwnTasks` if:
* Its action is specified as acceptable to that call.
* All dependencies of the task have been settled: all tasks specifying its task ID in their
  `ToSignal` list have completed.
* The task is not claimed by another worker.  Either:
  - the task is in state `pending`, or
  - the task is in state `in-progress`, but its `ActionDeadline` has elapsed (see "ownership
    expiry", below).

`OwnTasks` returns task IDs and for each returned task a "performance token" for this
performance of it.  Both ID and token must be provided to _return_ the task from ownership.
(The performance token is used to resolve conflicts during "ownership expiry", below.)

A typical use is that a worker loop repeatedly calls `OwnTasks` on one or more actions, and
dispatches each to a separate function.  The application controls concurrency by setting the
number of concurrent worker loops.  For instance, it might set 20 worker loops to perform "copy"
and "delete" tasks and a single worker loop to perform "report to DataDog".

Once a worker owns a task, it performs it.  It can decide to return the task to the task
queue and _complete_, _abort_ or _retry_ it by calling `ReturnTask`.  Once completed, all
dependents of the task are signalled, causing any dependent that has received all its
required signals to be eligible for return by `OwnTasks`.

#### Ownership expiry

Processes can fail.  To allow restarting a failed process calls to `OwnTasks` may specify a
deadline.  The lease granted to an owning worker will expire after this deadline, allowing
another worker to own the task.  Only the _last_ worker granted ownership may call
`ReturnTask` on the task.  A delayed worker should still return the task, in case the task
has not yet been granted to another worker.

#### Basic API

This is a sample API.  All details are fully subject to change, of course!  Note that most
`func`s are probably going to be methods on some object, which we assume will carry DB
connection information etc.

##### TaskData

```go
type TaskId string

type ActorId string

type PerformanceToken pgtype.UUID // With added stringifiers

// TaskData describes a task to perform.
type TaskData struct {
	Id         TaskId              // Unique ID of task
	Action     string              // Action to perform, used to fetch in OwnTasks
	Body       *string             // Body containing details of action, used by clients only
	Status     *string             // Human- and client-readable status
	StatusCode TaskStatusCodeValue // Status code, used by task queue
	NumTries   int                 // Number of times this task has moved from started to in-progress
	MaxTries   *int                // Maximal number of times to try this task
	// Dependencies might be stored or handled differently, depending on what gives reasonable
	// performance.
	TotalDependencies *int              // Number of tasks which must signal before this task can be owned
	ToSignal          []TaskId          // Tasks to signal after this task is done
	ActorId           ActorId           // ID of current actor performing this task (if in-progress)
	ActionDeadline    *time.Time        // Deadline for current actor to finish performing this task (if in-progress)
	PerformanceToken  *PerformanceToken // Token to allow ReturnTask
	PostResult        bool              // If set allow waiting for this task using WaitForTask
}
```

##### InsertTasks

```go
// InsertTasks atomically adds all tasks to the queue: if any task cannot be added (typically because
// it re-uses an existing key) then no tasks will be added.  If PostResult was set on any tasks then
// they can be waited upon after InsertTasks returns.
func InsertTasks(ctx context.Context, source *taskDataIterator) error
```

A variant allows inserting a task _by force_

```go
// ReplaceTasks atomically adds all tasks to the queue.   If a task not yet in-process with the same
// ID already exists then _replace it_ as though it were atomically aborted before this insert.  If
// PostResult was set on any tasks then they can be waited upon after InsertTasks returns.  Tasks that
// are in process cannot be replaced.
func ReplaceTasks(ctx context.Context, source *taskDataIterator) error
```

##### OwnTasks

```go
// OwnedTaskData is a task returned from OwnedTask
type OwnedTaskData struct {
	Id    TaskId           `db:"task_id"`
	Token PerformanceToken `db:"token"`
	Action string
	Body  *string
}

// OwnTasks owns for actor and returns up to maxTasks tasks for performing any of actions, setting
// the lifetime of each returned owned task to maxDuration.
func OwnTasks(ctx context.Context, actor ActorId, maxTasks int, actions []string, maxDuration *time.Duration) ([]OwnedTaskData, error)
```

`maxDuration` should be a time during which no other worker can access the task.  It does not
have to be the time to _complete_ the task: workers can periodically call `ExtendTasksOwnership`
to extend the lifetime.

##### ExtendTasksOwnership

```go
// ExtendTasksOwnership extends the current action lifetime for each of task by another maxDuration,
// if that task is still owned by this actor with that performance token.  It returns true for each
// task if it is still owned, or false if ownership extension failed because the task is no longer
// owned.
func ExtendTasksOwnership(ctx context.Context, actor ActorId, toExtend []OwnedTaskData, maxDuration time.Duration) ([]bool, error)
```

##### ReturnTask

```go
// ReturnTask returns taskId which was acquired using the specified performanceToken, giving it
// resultStatus and resultStatusCode.  It returns InvalidTokenError if the performanceToken is
// invalid; this happens when ReturnTask is called after its deadline expires, or due to a logic
// error.  If resultStatusCode is ABORT, abort all succeeding tasks.
func ReturnTask(ctx context.Context, taskId TaskId, token PerformanceToken, resultStatus string, resultStatusCode TaskStatusCodeValue) error
```

##### WaitForTask

```go
// WaitForTask waits for taskId (which must have been started wth PostResult) to finish and
// returns it.  It returns immediately the task has already finished.
func WaitForTask(ctx context.Context, taskId TaskId) (TaskData, error)
```

##### AddDependencies

```go
// AddDependencies atomically adds dependencies: for every dependency,  task Run must  run after
// task After.
type TaskDependency interface {
	After, Run TaskID
}

func AddDependencies(ctx context.Context, dependencies []TaskDependency) error
```

##### Monitoring

Also some routine as a basis for monitoring: it gives the number and status of each of a number
of actions and task IDs, possibly with some filtering.  The exact nature depends on the
implementation chosen, however we _do_ require its availability.

#### Differences from the Celery model

This task management model is at a somewhat lower level than the Celery model:
* **Workers explicitly loop to own and handle tasks.** Emulate the Celery model by writing an
  explicit function that takes "handlers" for the different actions.  We may well do this.

  _Why change?_ Writing the loop is rarely an important factor.  Flexibility in specifying the
  action parameter of OwnTasks allows variable actions, for instance handling particular action
  types only when a particular environmental condition is met (say, system load), or
  incorporating side data in action names (and not only in task IDs).  Flexibility in timing
  allows a per-process rate limiters for particular actions: filter out expensive actions when
  their token bucket runs out.  Flexibility in specifying _when_ OwnTasks is called allows
  controlling load on the queuing component.  Flexibility in specifying action dispatch allows
  controlling _how many goroutines_ run particular actions concurrently.  All this without
  having to add configurable structures to the task manager.
* **No explicit graph structures.** Emulate these using the section [Structures][#structures]
  below.
* **No implicit argument serialization.** Rather than flatten an "args" array we pass a stringy
  "body".  In practice "args" anyway require serialization; incorporating them into the queue
  requires either configuring the queue with relevant serialization or allowing only primitives.
  Celery selects the first, Machinery the second.  In both cases a Go client library must place
  most of the serialization burden on application code -- simplest is to do so explicitly.

#### Structures

We can implement what Celery calls _Chains_, _Chords_ and _Groups_ using the basic API: these
are just ways to describe structured dependencies which form [parallel/serial
networks][parallel-series] networks.  Drawings appear below.

##### Chains

```
    +----------+
    |  task 1  |
    +----------+
         |
         |
    +----v-----+
    |  task 2  |
    +----+-----+
         |
         |
    +----v-----+
    |  task 3  |
    +----------+
```

##### Chords (and Groups)

```
                    +--------+
               +--->|  task1 +-----+
               |    +--------+     |
               |                   |
               |                   |
               |    +--------+     |
               +--->|  task2 +-----+
               |    +--------+     |
 +-------+     |                   |     +-------------+
 |  prev |-----+                   +---->|(spontaneous)|
 +-------+     |    +--------+     |     +-------------+
               +--->|  task3 +-----+
               |    +--------+     |
               |                   |
               |                   |
               |    +--------+     |
               +--->|  task4 +-----+
                    +--------+
```

## Implementing "user" stories with the API

### Branch export

Each branch uses separate tasks arranged in a cycle.  These names are task IDs with a matching
action name: e.g. the action name for `next-export-{branch}` is `next-export`.  (The branch name
also appears in the body.)

* `next-export-{branch}` is to start the next export if an export is already underway, by
  creating a task `start-export-{branch}`.
* `start-export-{branch}` handles the actual logic of generating the copy tasks in a network,
  leading eventually to the task `done-export-{branch}` (which is also generates) becoming
  available.
* `done-export-{branch}` is there so that `next-export-{branch}` can depend on it -- and not
  start before the current export operation terminates.  (If it does not exist,
  `next-export-{branch}` has no dependency blocking it and can run immediately.)

The actual steps:
1. Under the merge/commit lock for the branch: _replace_ the task with ID `next-export-{branch}`
     with a task to export _this_ commit ID.  And add a dependency on `done-export-{branch}`
     (which may fail if that task has completed; that is safe).
1. To handle `next-export-{branch}`: create `start-export-{branch}` (the previous one must have
   ended), and return the task.
1. To handle `start-export-{branch}`:
   1. Generate a task to copy or delete each file object (this is an opportunity to batch
      multiple file objects if performance doesn't match.  `done-export-{branch}` depends on
      each of these tasks (and cannot have been deleted since `start-export-{branch}` has not
      yet been returned).  For every prefix for which such an object is configured, add a task
      to generate its `.../_SUCCESS` object on S3, dependent on all the objects under that
      prefix (or, to handle objects in sub-prefixes, on just the `_SUCCESS` of that sub-prefix).
   1. Add a task to generate manifests, dependent on `done-export-{branch}`.
   1. Return `start-export-{branch}` as completed.
1. To handle a copy or delete operation, perform it.
1. To handle `done-export-{branch}`: just return it, it can be spontaneous (if the task queue
   supports that).

`next-export-{branch}` is used to serialize branch exports, achieving the requirement for single
concurrent export per branch.  Per-prefix `_SUCCESS` objects are generated on time due to their
dependencies.  (As an option, we could set priorities and return tasks in priority order from
`OwnTasks`, to allow `_SUCCESS` objects to be created before copying other objects.)  Retries
are handled by setting multiple per-copy attempts.

### Concurrent dedupe batching

1. For every created object, create a dedupe task.
2. To perform a dedupe task, acquire its checksum (from computation or ETag) and set a task to
   write a dedupe record.
3. Acquire tasks _many_ dedupe records at a time, and process those in batches.
