## What is lakeFS

lakeFS is an open source layer that delivers resilience and manageability to object-storage based data lakes.

With lakeFS you can build repeatable, atomic and versioned data lake operations - from complex ETL jobs to data science and analytics.

lakeFS is API compatible with AWS S3 and works seamlessly with all modern data frameworks such as Spark, Hive, AWS Athena, Presto, etc.

## Capabilities

**Atomic Operations** - lakeFS allows data producers to manipulate multiple objects as a single, atomic operation. If something fails half-way, all changes can be instantly rolled back.

**Consistency** - lakeFS enables object-level and cross-collection consistency:
  - object-level consistency ensures all operations within a branch are strongly consistent (read-after-write, list-after-write, read-after-delete, etc).
  - cross-collection consistency is achieved by providing snapshot isolation. Using branches, writers can provide consistency guarantees across different logical   collections - merging to “main” is only done after several datasets have been created successfully.

**History** - Commits are retained for a configurable duration, so readers can query data from the latest commit, or from any other point in time. Writers can atomically and safely rollback changes to previous versions.

**Cross-Lake Isolation** - Creating a lakeFS branch provides you with a snapshot of the entire lake at a given point in time.
All reads from that branch are    guaranteed to always return the same results.

**Data CI/CD** - The ability to define automated rules and tests that are required to pass before committing or merging changes to data.
