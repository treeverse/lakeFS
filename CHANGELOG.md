## v0.80.0 - 2022-08-31

This release requires running database migration.
The lakeFS service will not run if the migration version isn't compatible with the binary.
Before running the new version you will be required to run migrate, with the new version. 
Please refer to this [upgrade documentation](https://docs.lakefs.io/reference/upgrade.html##lakefs-0800-or-greater-kv-migration) for more information on the specific migration to KV

This is the first lakeFS version over Key-Value Store
lakeFS is decoupling from PostgreSQL and moving to a KV Store interface. 
This will provide greater flexibility and allow production groups working with lakeFS to select their backing DB of choice.  
Check our updated [Deploy lakeFS](https://docs.lakefs.io/deploy/#deploy-lakefs) page, for deployment instructions.
Also make sure to check our [Sizing Guide](https://docs.lakefs.io/understand/sizing-guide.html#lakefs-kv-store) for best practices, requirements and benchmarks

## v0.40.0 - 2021-04-20

This is a big release for lakeFS with many notable improvements.

Some of these are breaking changes. It's always a tough decision to introduce a change that isn't backwards compatible,
but we felt that at this stage they represent a significant enough benefit to be worth it.

Going forward, our goal is to make as few of those as possible, as we near a 1.0.0 release.

Here are the most notable changes:

### lakeFS is now OpenAPI 3.0 compliant ✨

The lakeFS API has been migrated from OpenAPI 2.0 to OpenAPI 3.0.

[OpenAPI 3.0](https://swagger.io/specification/) includes many improvements over the previous version: Cookie based authentication, reusable query parameters, better JSON Schema support and more.

While homegrown clients that simply use the lakeFS API as a REST inteface will continue to work,
client that relied on OpenAPI 2.0 specific behaviors will stop working.

This includes the previously recommended [bravado](https://github.com/Yelp/bravado) based client for Python. For that reason, we're also releasing an officially supported Python client:

### lakeFS now ships with a native Python client ✨

It's now as simple as:

```sh
$ pip install lakefs-client~=0.40.0
```

And then:

```python
import lakefs_client
from lakefs_client.client import LakeFSClient

lakefs = LakeFSClient(lakefs_client.Configuration(
    username='AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE', 
    password='...', 
    host='http://lakefs.example.com'))
    
lakefs.branches.list_branches(repository='my-repo')  # Or any other API action
```

This client is officially supported and distributed by the lakeFS team, and will be released in conjunction with lakeFS releases, so it should always align in capabilities with the latest lakeFS versions.

For more information, see the [Python Client Documentation](https://docs.lakefs.io/using/python.html).

### Native Spark client, allowing to export a commit (or set of commits) to another object store ✨

Using Apache Spark, lakeFS users can now quickly export the contents of a branch to an external location (say, S3 bucket). Exporting committed data will be parallelized using Spark workers to support copying millions of objects in minutes.

This is the first feature released based on lakeFS' Spark integration (soon to be followed by data retention for stale objects), and a native `lakefs://` filesystem support for Spark).

For more information, see the [Export Job configuration Documentation](https://docs.lakefs.io/reference/export.html).

### lakeFS standardized URIs ✨

The lakeFS CLI now supports a standardized URI in the form: `lakefs://<repository>/<ref>/<path>`.
Additionally, the CLI now allows setting a `$LAKECTL_BASE_URI` environment variable that, if set, will prefix any relative URI used.

For example, instead of:

```sh
$ lakectl diff lakefs://my-repository/my-branch lakefs://my-repository/main
$ lakectl fs ls lakefs://my-repository/my-branch/path/
```

It's now possible to simply do:

```sh
$ export LAKECTL_BASE_URI="lakefs://my-repository/"
$ lakectl diff my-branch main
$ lakectl fs ls mybranch/path/
```

For more information, see the [CLI Command Reference Documentation](https://docs.lakefs.io/reference/commands.html).


### Complete UI Overhaul

Making it faster, more responsive and contains many improvements to pagination, commit browsing and action views.

## v0.30.0 - 2021-01-26

This is the first release of [lakeFS on the Rocks](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jzD7-jun-tdU5BGapmnMBe9ovSzBvTNjXCcVztV07A4/edit?usp=sharing)! :tada:
Included is a big change to lakeFS' data model, which is now much closer to Git's.


### Main benefits

1. Metadata representing committed versions now lives on the object store itself (instead of on PostgreSQL)
2. As a result, PostgreSQL will now typically be smaller and do much less than in previous versions
3. Performance should be more predictable, and noticeably better across the board, especially on large diffs/commits/merges
