## 0.2.3

## 0.2.2

* Update lakeFS SDK to 1.12.0
* Use overwrite in lakeFSLinker to control If-None-Match

## 0.2.1

## 0.2.0

### Breaking changes

* New required fields added to StorageConfig API (#6509).  **:warning: This
  is a breaking change:** Only lakeFS server versions >= 0.108.0 are
  supported.

### Bug fixes

* Better handling of quotes and encoding of ETags / checksums, especially
  relevant to Azure (#6756).
* Correctly parse physical URIs that contain whitespace (#5827).

### This release contains significant maintenance changes

None of these are user-visible, but all may be of interest.

* Unit test using mockserver (#6646).  Unit tests now more accurate _and_
  faster.
* Use upcoming future-proof SDK (#6737).  This change servers as an example
  of how you might transition other code to the new future-proof SDK.

  Additionally, :warning: if you do not use an assembled hadoopfs "Ãœber" Jar
  then you will need to change your dependencies to include `io.lakefs:sdk`
  rather than `io.lakefs:api-client`.

  existing Spark configurations.
